Refreshing, tasty and guiltless beverages are too few and far between these days, but this qualifies.<br /><br />Far too many \"vitamin drinks\" on the shelf are packed with empty calories, high-fructose corn syrup, and no actual fruit juice (or anything else good for you, for that matter). This is a refreshing exception.<br /><br />The pros: 70% juice, not overly calorie-ridden, the Izze drinks DO contain a bit of Vitamins C, B6 and Niacin, but do NOT contain any dreaded (and seemingly ubiquitous) high-fructose corn syrup (about which I have heard nothing good. Not one thing), and it tastes really good.<br /><br />The cons: Okay, not so much a con perhaps, but one should be aware that the product contains no more than 10% of the RDA of any of the aforementioned vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />So as long as you don't think of it as a magic health elixir, but rather as a great-tasting, refreshing drink that appears to contain nothing bad for you, I think you will enjoy this drink as much as I have.\n",

      " Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />**** Recommended with warm fuzzies.<br /><br />I just received my single 2.25-ounce bar this morning and it was a good thing that I already ate breakfast as I nibbled (instead of chomped) on this with my morning coffee.  I have always liked all of Newman's line of foods, because they taste good and are made of high-quality ingredients, and because his foundation donates hundreds of millions of dollars to charities throughout the world.  (And I love his movies! :-)  Paul Newman walked the philanthropic walk in helping to make the world a better place.<br /><br />This 54% cocoa dark chocolate bar has an all-organic ingredient list that is free of artificial sweetener and extraneous additives and fillers, which is all too common in chocolates, candies, and foods these days.<br /><br />Note that, at the time of this review's writing, the \"Ingredients\" and \"Nutrition Facts\" listed on Amazon's site for this dark chocolate bar are actually copied from another \"Newman's\" chocolate bar, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHYQQC\">Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar, 2.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> , and so this information that is currently listed on Amazon's site for this dark chocolate does NOT apply to this product; it refers to Newman's Milk Chocolate.  Hopefully, Amazon will correct the listings in these two sections for this product.<br /><br />Amazon's \"Ingredients\" listing: Organic Milk Chocolate (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Whole Milk Powder, Organic Chocolate Liquor, Organic Soy Lecithin [An Emulsifier], Organic Vanilla), Natural Coffee Flavor.<br /><br />Actual Wrapper's \"Ingredients\" listing: Organic Dark Chocolate (Organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin [an emulsifier], organic vanilla).<br /><br />Wrapper's \"Nutrition Facts\" listing (with Amazon's corresponding \"Nutrition Facts\" listing, that actually apply to Newman's Milk Chocolate bar, in parentheses):<br /><br />Calories:  330 (340)<br />Calories from Fat: 200 (190)<br />Total Fat:  22g 34%DV (23g 35%DV)<br />Saturated Fat:  13g 65%DV (12g 60%DV)<br />Monounsaturated and Trans Fat: 0g (0g)<br />Cholesterol:  0g 0%DV (5mg 2%DV)<br />Sodium:  5mg (30mg)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 37g 12%DV (37g 12%DV)<br />Fiber:  4g 16%DV (1g 4%DV)<br />Sugars:  28g (33g)<br />Protein:  3g (3g)<br />Vitamin A:  0% (2%)<br />Vitamin C:  0% (2%)<br />Calcium:  2% (20%)<br />Iron:  10% (15%)<br /><br />So Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar has more vitamins, calcium, and iron due to its use of milk, while the dark chocolate has more fiber and less sodium.  Many people do not consider chocolate to be a high-fiber food, but dark chocolate (not milk chocolate) ranks among the top-20 for high-fiber foods.  Dark chocolate is loaded with flavonoids that act as antioxidants, keeping your heart healthy and reducing oxidative stress.  Flavonoids also balance hormones in your body, and they activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase levels in your body (biochemical gibberish that translates to \"helps regulate your blood pressure\" :-)  Studies have also shown that dark chocolate, perhaps due to its increased fiber content, makes you feel more \"filled up\", giving you more of a feeling of satiety compared with eating milk chocolate.<br /><br />At the time of this review's writing, Amazon had not yet priced this chocolate. But even if it was priced higher than other dark chocolates offered by the larger candy factories, I would still buy this because I believe in Newman's cause and charities.  I also love dark chocolate that is combined with nuts and/or berries, such as the Chocolove dark chocolates, and I hope that the \"Newman's\" dark chocolates line also eventually includes those.<br /><br />I love dark chocolates with cocoa content that goes to 77% and beyond, but these are not as sweet and have a subtle bitterness compared to dark chocolates with lower cocoa content.  The 54% cocoa content of this Newman's bar strikes a happy balance of sweetness that will appeal to those who are more accustomed to milk chocolate's sweetness.  This chocolate is not as sweet as some of the other 54-55% cocoa dark chocolates out there because many dark chocolates add higher amounts of extra sugar to their bars.  The flavor of this chocolate is nice, but with a slightly fibrous texture; just don't expect it to be as sweet as some of the more-sweetened dark chocolates on the market or else you may think that this tastes a bit bland compared to them.  Likewise, some people think that heavily-salted food tastes better than lightly-salted food.  The \"evaporated cane juice\" used as a sweetener in this chocolate is a healthier alternative than the processed sugar that is included in many chocolate bars (including the Belgium-made Chocolove bars that I love).  Both refined sugar and cane juice come from sugar cane, but cane juice is less processed and retains more nutrients.  So enjoy this smooth rich dark chocolate \"health food\" guilt-free, but in moderation.  I certainly will enjoy eating the rest of this chocolate bar while watching my DVD of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019UGYK0\">Cool Hand Luke (Deluxe Edition)</a>\n",

My Mistake! It smelled like bad bubblegum and tasted like Windex or something - just a terrible, chemical taste. i made the icing, then tasted it and thought \"what was on my finger!? nail polish remover or something?\" well I hadn't done my nails, it was the icing! i could not serve that. I had to start over and use vanilla at the last minute. Thankfully the bride was very understanding. I DO NOT recommend this product.

      " This is a really nice product for those who want to consume healthful things. Refreshing, tasty and guiltless beverages are too few and far between these days, but this qualifies.<br /><br />Far too many \"vitamin drinks\" on the shelf are packed with empty calories, high-fructose corn syrup, and no actual fruit juice (or anything else good for you, for that matter). This is a refreshing exception.<br /><br />The pros: 70% juice, not overly calorie-ridden, the Izze drinks DO contain a bit of Vitamins C, B6 and Niacin, but do NOT contain any dreaded (and seemingly ubiquitous) high-fructose corn syrup (about which I have heard nothing good. Not one thing), and it tastes really good.<br /><br />The cons: Okay, not so much a con perhaps, but one should be aware that the product contains no more than 10% of the RDA of any of the aforementioned vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />So as long as you don't think of it as a magic health elixir, but rather as a great-tasting, refreshing drink that appears to contain nothing bad for you, I think you will enjoy this drink as much as I have.\n",

I tried each flavor and not one cat will eat this stuff! I was hoping to save some money with Friskies, but it is what it is. And what it is is food that a hungry wild cat won't eat; she'd rather catch and eat mice. :\\ My suggestion is to go to the store and buy a couple different cans and try that out first.

      " After our father died, my sister inherited Duke, our dad's 4 month old orange tabby kitten.  My sister kept him for over a year, but decided she couldn't keep him anymore, so in 2010, I grudgingly adopted him.  (I'm sentimental and couldn't let a cat that once belonged to our dad end up in the hands of strangers.)  I am a rabid dog fanatic.  I like cats, but don't have the same enthusiasm for them that I do with dogs.  I never had a feline companion of my own, so Duke became my \"starter cat\".  Well, I turned out to be lucky.  Duke is not the hide-under-the-bed-and-hiss kind of cat.  He's adorable, funny, affectionate, and loves Slappy, my elderly German Shepherd mix.  He's definitely a keeper and I love him to pieces.  He's three years old now, and he's stuck with me for life.<br /><br />So, being that Duke is my first cat, everything is a learning process.  I thought that semi-solid, extremely smelly poop was simply a variation of the norm for cats.  I was feeding Duke Before Grain, pretty much since the day I got him.  Duke liked it and had no problem scarfing it down.  (The little fattie will eat anything.)  I liked the quality ingredients and the lack of filler grains.  Meanwhile, his \"Litter Box of Horrors\" was a nightmare to clean.  The stench was overpowering.  Duke would do his business and the poop would stick to his legs.  I had to throw him in the shower several times a month.  Eventually, I had to follow him around the house with baby wipes after he used his litter box or else he'd leave stinky poop stains on my floor, couch, bed, or carpet.  I simply figured that since he's fat, he couldn't clean himself well.  I never attributed it to the food.  Why would I?  I assumed I was giving him the best.<br /><br />Last year, he was treated for a urinary blockage caused by struvite crystals.  Then, a few months ago, while wiping his butt with baby wipes, I found blood.  Quite a bit of it.  I opened his litter box, and his stool was covered in blood.  Off to the vet we went.  No problems detected.  Lots of money spent.  I was told to put him on Hill's Science Diet.  That stuff is garbage and if ANY vet tells you to put your cat or dog on it, it's time to find a new vet.  Anyway, the bloody poop happened again a few days later.  I decided that yes, I was going to change his diet, but no, it wouldn't be Hill's Science Diet.  Taste of The Wild ended up being my choice.  Within days, all the problems went away.  Duke has very firm stool now, there's no blood, the litter box stench is more tolerable, and no more \"Hershey's Kisses\" on everything he sits on.  No more baby wipes and showers, so I don't have to hear his mournful cries when he's subjected to being scrubbed down.<br /><br />I'm not saying that B.G. is a bad food, but I'm saying it was a very bad option for me and my cat.  There was something in there that my cat couldn't tolerate.  I won't buy it again.  I'll keep him on a combination of TOTW and raw.  It works for him.\n",

      " I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called \"cat\" food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers.  My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk.  It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their \"flavors\" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is \"good\" food, I can't imagine the crap you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you!  Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.\n",

      " I've been a tea fan for decades; I've written about tea and published stories about tea. I can tell you about second flush Darjeelings and \"tippy golden\" varieties. Like most self-styled \"serious\" tea drinkers, I've never been a fan of bagged tea, preferring to brew from \"loose\" leaves.<br /><br />Given all of that, I have to say that the Higgins & Burke was a very nice surprise. English Breakfast can mean a lot of things, but the leading element of the blend is usually Assam tea, which is known for its supposedly \"malty\" flavor. The H&B lists Assam as a main ingredient, which was good to see.<br /><br />The bags have a \"flow through\" design, which is also a good thing; this gives more surface area to the bags and allows for fuller brewing.<br /><br />I brewed up a pot--- not a cup. These tea bags really ought to be put in a pot. If you brew them in a cup, unless you cover it the water will cool too quickly during brewing, and besides, you'll have to reduce the brewing time to too short a length for best results.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the pots that I tried. The Assam flavor was rich and husky; the finished brew was smooth rather than rough; there was none of the staleness that sometimes comes with inferior bagged tea (which is sometimes made from sweepings and leavings). While I wouldn't have this for an after-dinner tea--- Assam is just too assertive--- it's a terrific breakfast tea, as the name implies.<br /><br />Of course, you can argue that if you're making a pot you might as well use loose-leaf tea and be done with it. That's a valid argument, but use of the bags certainly makes for faster clean-up and less effort overall. So besides being good, these tea bags do have a definite role.<br /><br />I'm pleased to be able to recommend this product. It has made me rethink the idea of bagged tea.\n",

      " *****<br />This Bedtime Tea from Yogi Tea is an herbal tea that is relaxing and a natural sleep aid. Bedtime Tea is made from organic licorice root, organic spearmint leaf, organic chamomile flower, organic skullcap leaf, organic cardamom seed, organic cinnamon bark, organic St. John's Wort leaf & flower, organic rose hips, natural orange flavor, valerian root extract, organic raspberry leaf, organic English lavender flower, steveia leaf, and passion flower extract. The taste is mild, delicious, herb-y, and very slightly sweet. It is subtle and lovely.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Bedtime Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: \"Organic Bedtime tea is a safe, gentle and delicious way to help you get a restful night's sleep.Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) and other calming herbs included in this organic formula have been used for centuries to promote sleep without the risk of a morning \"hangover\" that can sometimes result from the use of drug products. This healing formula also includes Organic Chamomile (Matricaria recutita), which has been used for years by Western herbalists to soothe and relax and for its effectiveness in combating nervousness and restlessness. Mild relaxants such as Organic St. John's Wort and Passion Flower are also included in this formula. St. John's Wort is well known for its positive effects on mood, while Passion Flower, a Native American herb containing the naturally occurring chemical chrysina, a flavonoid, has been shown to help reduce nervousness and anxiety. This tea is also enhanced with Organic Skullcap, which has scutellarian, a plant compound that has been shown to help reduce anxiety. To help promote better and deeper sleep, health practitioners recommend avoiding caffeine products. Drink organic Bedtime tea before bed for a good night's sleep.\"<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that this tea is not to be used during pregnancy or while nursing. If you are taking MAO inhibitors or other prescription drugs, you should consult your physician or health care professional before use. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal.<br /><br />Best of all, it works...I love drinking it before bed to relax and drift off into blissful sleep. This is a great tea that I highly recommend.<br />*****\n",

      " I shared this product with a person in my office who drinks tea daily.  (I'm a big coffee drinker, so I don't drink tea every day.)<br /><br />My initial impression was that while this tea smelled good once the bag was opened, the tea itself had almost no aroma once brewed and the tea didn't have much flavor either.  I thought that perhaps I had not brewed it long enough even though I had brewed it a full 5 minutes (the manufacturer recommends brewing 3-5 minutes), so I threw the bag back in my cup of tea.  Despite leaving the bag in the cup as I finished drinking the tea, the tea never got much flavor as far as I was concerned.  Then again I'm used to drinking really strong coffee, so I thought that perhaps my taste buds were simply used to a stronger flavor.<br /><br />Enter my co-worker.  I specifically did not tell her my impression of the tea because I wanted her unbiased opinion.  She was excited by the description of the tea on the box and brewed a cup for herself as she normally does every morning at the beginning of the work day.  She just stopped by my desk to give me her feedback.  Her main description of the tea was \"bland.\"  She said it did not taste bad, but that it did not have much flavor.  In other words, her perception of this tea matched mine.  She further added that she would not buy this tea.  She didn't even want the rest of the box from me, so I'm simply going to put it out in our lunchroom in the hopes that perhaps some people where I work will enjoy it.  Who knows -- maybe this tea will impress at least one of my coworkers and they'll decide to purchase this tea.  I know I wouldn't.\n",

      " First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.<br /><br />While I personally do not believe the phrase \"You get what you pay for\" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.<br /><br />I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).<br /><br />But, first of all, this isn't \"in the raw\". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAW<br /><br />Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled \"raw\" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it.  Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself \"raw\" either.<br /><br />But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?<br /><br />Huh-uh.<br /><br />You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.<br />You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.<br /><br />Superb huh?<br /><br />Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think \"Woo Hoo! I get more for less!\" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.<br /><br />Not so fast.<br /><br />I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter.  I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.<br /><br />So that got me thinking...<br /><br />I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.<br />It is 1.75 ounces.<br />I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!<br /><br />WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.<br /><br />And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.<br /><br />But, wait...one more thing...<br /><br />Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too.  Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart. Erythritol is a stevia cousin. Dextrose is a cheap filler that isn't.\n",

      " we love sodastream soda maker but not its syrups.  my bf is a soda addict, drink soda like water, who sneaks out to a deli, which is at least 15 mins away as the closest ones closed at midnight, for a 2 Liter bottle of cherry coke at 3am in the morning. i bought the sodastream jet starter kit and this sodamix variety pack for him as i don't want to buy bottles of sodas from supermarket, carrying them walking at least 2 flights of stairs, separating the trash for recycle and dragging bags of empty bottles out which he promised he will help but rarely does. i bought sodastream totally because i m lazy but not being eco-friendly at all. the 1st day we received them, he made 4 different flavors and made me to finish them all with him that night. he loves to play with the loud buzz button and constantly needs new bottle for another flavor as the starter kit comes with only 1 bpa free bottle.  i never like anything fizzy while he likes it bubbles until his blood fizz like the soda. we tried #1.fountain mist #2.orange #3. lemon-lime #4.diet cola respectively. he hates anything \"diet\" and complained even the non diet syrups taste like diet. the last one he tested from the variety pack was the diet cola as it doesn't come with the regular cola which he craved. i said the diet cola taste like the regular cola n yuck. he agreed with the yuck but blah blah blah about the taste different between the regular coka cola coke n this sodamix diet cola syrup.  he believed that the sodamix regular cola syrup must be better than the diet one and planned to get it the next day. suddenly he screamed out \"splen-daaaaa\" in a weird accent while he was reading the ingredients/ nutrition facts. he lost interests in this variety pack and tried to fizz everything drinkable in the fridge: #5. welch's white grape cherry juice just by itself without water, it exploded while the bottle is still intact to the machine, mess everywhere, he said \"errrk\". #6. water+ribena, considering carbonating the juice creates messes, we just carbonated the water and substitute the syrup with something else, with the same amount of the individually packaged syrup from the variety pack, ribena isnt as concentrated, i continued added more ribena but still taste bland and ended up ran out of ribena. #7. we bought the sodamix regular cola from BB&B the today, while pouring the syrup in after carbonating the water, it just splashed all over the counter top and the kitchen floor. better pour it inside the sink.  he said it tastes better than the diet syrup but still has a slightly aspartame/weird sugar after taste, not as good as the regular coca cola. #8. carbonated water+OJ: 1/4 cup of carbonated water + 3/4 cup of no pulp OJ = taste is ok, less strong, not fizzy. 1/2 cup of carbonated water + 3/4 cup of no pulp OJ: not fizzy and taste only with a tint of OJ. 1 cup of carbonated water + 1 cup of no pulp OJ, fizzy but bland.  We bought the sodamix cherry cola syrup, but we r full from drinking carbonated sugared liquid these 2 days. we will try it and update tomorrow.\n",

      " I also reviewed the Jones Soda Berry Pomegranate vitamin water and that one fell short because it was mostly water and sugar and cost over $1 per bottle.<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine is much better in my opinion in terms of flavor. It's also carbonated up quite a bit and has added ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) which gives it a lot of tang/bite. For me it isn't unpleasant at all - I like it.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviews, I don't get the medicine aftertaste. It's just a good, refreshing, carbonated drink. I tried this after getting in from a fairly warm bike ride and it does a pretty good job of quenching thirst. I tried it straight from a room temperature can and over ice and both were great. I like it over ice better, though. Then, just for fun, I added some Malibu rum to see how it was as a mixer and it's not bad. I won't be asking for it at a bar, but it gets the fruity flavor with the coconut rum and I think if someone was creative, this could be a match made in heaven.<br /><br />The down side (to me) is this is another fairly pricey drink. The cans aren't full-size cans either. So for almost $1 per can you get a smallish 8.3 ounces but with regular sodas you get 12 ounces - half again as much. Of course, sodas aren't 100% juice either.<br /><br />Upshot is if I'm on a beach somewhere and hot and thirsty, I'd probably buy this. For stocking at home, I'll stick with regular frozen orange juice or orange juice in a carton. I would recommend trying it for yourself, though. This seems to be one of those drinks that could sway pretty hard depending on personal preferences.\n",

      " Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />**** Recommended with warm fuzzies.<br /><br />I just received my single 2.25-ounce bar this morning and it was a good thing that I already ate breakfast as I nibbled (instead of chomped) on this with my morning coffee.  I have always liked all of Newman's line of foods, because they taste good and are made of high-quality ingredients, and because his foundation donates hundreds of millions of dollars to charities throughout the world.  (And I love his movies! :-)  Paul Newman walked the philanthropic walk in helping to make the world a better place.<br /><br />This 54% cocoa dark chocolate bar has an all-organic ingredient list that is free of artificial sweetener and extraneous additives and fillers, which is all too common in chocolates, candies, and foods these days.<br /><br />Note that, at the time of this review's writing, the \"Ingredients\" and \"Nutrition Facts\" listed on Amazon's site for this dark chocolate bar are actually copied from another \"Newman's\" chocolate bar, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHYQQC\">Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar, 2.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> , and so this information that is currently listed on Amazon's site for this dark chocolate does NOT apply to this product; it refers to Newman's Milk Chocolate.  Hopefully, Amazon will correct the listings in these two sections for this product.<br /><br />Amazon's \"Ingredients\" listing: Organic Milk Chocolate (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Whole Milk Powder, Organic Chocolate Liquor, Organic Soy Lecithin [An Emulsifier], Organic Vanilla), Natural Coffee Flavor.<br /><br />Actual Wrapper's \"Ingredients\" listing: Organic Dark Chocolate (Organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin [an emulsifier], organic vanilla).<br /><br />Wrapper's \"Nutrition Facts\" listing (with Amazon's corresponding \"Nutrition Facts\" listing, that actually apply to Newman's Milk Chocolate bar, in parentheses):<br /><br />Calories:  330 (340)<br />Calories from Fat: 200 (190)<br />Total Fat:  22g 34%DV (23g 35%DV)<br />Saturated Fat:  13g 65%DV (12g 60%DV)<br />Monounsaturated and Trans Fat: 0g (0g)<br />Cholesterol:  0g 0%DV (5mg 2%DV)<br />Sodium:  5mg (30mg)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 37g 12%DV (37g 12%DV)<br />Fiber:  4g 16%DV (1g 4%DV)<br />Sugars:  28g (33g)<br />Protein:  3g (3g)<br />Vitamin A:  0% (2%)<br />Vitamin C:  0% (2%)<br />Calcium:  2% (20%)<br />Iron:  10% (15%)<br /><br />So Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar has more vitamins, calcium, and iron due to its use of milk, while the dark chocolate has more fiber and less sodium.  Many people do not consider chocolate to be a high-fiber food, but dark chocolate (not milk chocolate) ranks among the top-20 for high-fiber foods.  Dark chocolate is loaded with flavonoids that act as antioxidants, keeping your heart healthy and reducing oxidative stress.  Flavonoids also balance hormones in your body, and they activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase levels in your body (biochemical gibberish that translates to \"helps regulate your blood pressure\" :-)  Studies have also shown that dark chocolate, perhaps due to its increased fiber content, makes you feel more \"filled up\", giving you more of a feeling of satiety compared with eating milk chocolate.<br /><br />At the time of this review's writing, Amazon had not yet priced this chocolate. But even if it was priced higher than other dark chocolates offered by the larger candy factories, I would still buy this because I believe in Newman's cause and charities.  I also love dark chocolate that is combined with nuts and/or berries, such as the Chocolove dark chocolates, and I hope that the \"Newman's\" dark chocolates line also eventually includes those.<br /><br />I love dark chocolates with cocoa content that goes to 77% and beyond, but these are not as sweet and have a subtle bitterness compared to dark chocolates with lower cocoa content.  The 54% cocoa content of this Newman's bar strikes a happy balance of sweetness that will appeal to those who are more accustomed to milk chocolate's sweetness.  This chocolate is not as sweet as some of the other 54-55% cocoa dark chocolates out there because many dark chocolates add higher amounts of extra sugar to their bars.  The flavor of this chocolate is nice, but with a slightly fibrous texture; just don't expect it to be as sweet as some of the more-sweetened dark chocolates on the market or else you may think that this tastes a bit bland compared to them.  Likewise, some people think that heavily-salted food tastes better than lightly-salted food.  The \"evaporated cane juice\" used as a sweetener in this chocolate is a healthier alternative than the processed sugar that is included in many chocolate bars (including the Belgium-made Chocolove bars that I love).  Both refined sugar and cane juice come from sugar cane, but cane juice is less processed and retains more nutrients.  So enjoy this smooth rich dark chocolate \"health food\" guilt-free, but in moderation.  I certainly will enjoy eating the rest of this chocolate bar while watching my DVD of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019UGYK0\">Cool Hand Luke (Deluxe Edition)</a>\n",

This is a refreshing exception.<br /><br />The pros: 70% juice, not overly calorie-ridden, the Izze drinks DO contain a bit of Vitamins C, B6 and Niacin, but do NOT contain any dreaded (and seemingly ubiquitous) high-fructose corn syrup (about which I have heard nothing good. Not one thing), and it tastes really good.<br /><br />The cons: Okay, not so much a con perhaps, but one should be aware that the product contains no more than 10% of the RDA of any of the aforementioned vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />So as long as you don't think of it as a magic health elixir, but rather as a great-tasting, refreshing drink that appears to contain nothing bad for you, I think you will enjoy this drink as much as I have.\n",

I poured both into my deep fryer, and WOW!  I couldn't believe how easily and perfectly everything browned, and everything came out perfectly crispy on the outside.  On the inside, very moist and delicious.  Plus, this oil doesn't soak into the food like a lot of other oils, so you don't really get an oily or greasy taste.  I just received my next three bottles so I can change out the fryer next time.  I'm totally sold on this oil, and I really don't understand why it's not available everywhere. It browns and crisps better than peanut oil, is better for you than canola oil, has a higher smoke point than most oils, has a light taste that doesn't stick to foods, and makes a fantastic coating for charcoal grills to keep food from sticking to them.  After just a few weeks those are my observations, and I'm still finding things I like.  This is really THE PERFECT FRYING OIL.\n",

      " Really pleased with first order back in July. Not so much with the second order. When the second order arrived the packaging hinted at the difference. The first order was packaged better in a clear plastic bag inside the box. Second order came in gray plastic bag hiding the contents and was sloppily taped together. Inside was a baggie tied with a twist tie containing the candy that looked like someone did it in their kitchen almost. The product in the second order looked and tasted old, like something left in a warehouse too long. Candy is not fresh-tasting and it looks almost oxidized or something -- a strange, muddled color of purple. When I have bought Pops that looked like this at the store they always tasted old and were a little chewy. These look and taste the same, so guessing they have been sitting somewhere too long. The outer candy coating is chewy and somewhat soft (the middle is supposed to be chewy). So to sum: first order great tasting and nice package, second order tastes stale and the packaging was not as good. Both arrived quickly though, but probably won't buy this again.<br /><br />Update 10/12/2012: This order was not filled by Candy Mafia as I had thought. It was actually \"fulfilled\" by another Amazon vendor. I ordered from Candy Mafia previously and the product was excellent. So the review above does not apply to Candy Mafia.\n",

      " This is a really nice product for those who want to consume healthful things. Refreshing, tasty and guiltless beverages are too few and far between these days, but this qualifies.<br /><br />Far too many \"vitamin drinks\" on the shelf are packed with empty calories, high-fructose corn syrup, and no actual fruit juice (or anything else good for you, for that matter). This is a refreshing exception.<br /><br />The pros: 70% juice, not overly calorie-ridden, the Izze drinks DO contain a bit of Vitamins C, B6 and Niacin, but do NOT contain any dreaded (and seemingly ubiquitous) high-fructose corn syrup (about which I have heard nothing good. Not one thing), and it tastes really good.<br /><br />The cons: Okay, not so much a con perhaps, but one should be aware that the product contains no more than 10% of the RDA of any of the aforementioned vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />So as long as you don't think of it as a magic health elixir, but rather as a great-tasting, refreshing drink that appears to contain nothing bad for you, I think you will enjoy this drink as much as I have.\n",

Refreshing, tasty and guiltless beverages are too few and far between these days, but this qualifies.<br /><br />Far too many \"vitamin drinks\" on the shelf are packed with empty calories, high-fructose corn syrup, and no actual fruit juice (or anything else good for you, for that matter). This is a refreshing exception.<br /><br />The pros: 70% juice, not overly calorie-ridden, the Izze drinks DO contain a bit of Vitamins C, B6 and Niacin, but do NOT contain any dreaded (and seemingly ubiquitous) high-fructose corn syrup (about which I have heard nothing good. Not one thing), and it tastes really good.<br /><br />The cons: Okay, not so much a con perhaps, but one should be aware that the product contains no more than 10% of the RDA of any of the aforementioned vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />So as long as you don't think of it as a magic health elixir, but rather as a great-tasting, refreshing drink that appears to contain nothing bad for you, I think you will enjoy this drink as much as I have.\n",

Core is made with ingredients like real chicken--not chicken by-products or lots of grain.  Afterall, dogs are carnivores.  Since my dogs have been on Core they have not had the usual ear infections, skin allergies and irritations; their coats are beautiful; they have lots of energy and are overall very healthy.
