Yes, they do contain sodium (under 1200mg for the entire can) but that's pretty much typical of canned foods anymore, especially if you're looking at pre-seasoned products.

      " The first sip of Izze's sparkling apple juice was a bit of a shock, albeit a pleasant one.  It was bright and crisp, with an unexpectedly clear bite from the carbonation.  Tart enough that it really was a bit like taking a chunk out of a fresh Granny Smith.  Granted, some of this tartness comes from the other juices used in its creation, including but not necessarily limited to lemon and white grape.  Nonetheless, the flavor profile is all apple, and what's left (to borrow Izze's own tag line) is a \"naturally delightful\" and wholly refreshing vitamin-enriched (C, B6, and Niacin) beverage, delivered in a 8.4 fluid ounce slim can.<br /><br />We were impressed enough with the apple, that we went out and picked up bottles of blueberry, clementine, and peach.  Each provided similarly terrific tastes and experiences, although we did feel that the tartness that added to the apple juice 'realism' somewhat translated to less purely-blueberry (for example) profiles for some of the other flavors.  Nonetheless, we loved them all.<br /><br />Everyone's going to have different palettes and desires, but for a household that doesn't consume soft drinks, we found these to be a tasty and welcome diversion and alternative from our normal fare.  Izze has a new group of fans, and we're looking forward to trying more flavors.  Apple, at the very least, is going to be a staple around here.\n",

      " This is a great product with a fresh taste.  I am a school teacher and I use this powder every morning and it gets me all the way to lunch without feeling hungry.  I mix it with a banana, half cup blueberries, strawberries, yogurt, and 4 ounces of juice.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for a good way to add a large amount of fiber to your diet in an easy way.  The grittiness wasn't at all hard for me to get used to and I am a very picky eater so I figure if it's good for me, it will be good for most.  If you are watching your calorie intake, I recommend using half the designated serving size, I was a little surprised at the amount of calories in it, especially since I add all kinds of stuff to it.<br />Wonderful product!\n",

      " These are the absolute best things I have bought for my dog! We got them when she was a puppy and it was a savior. I really feel it got her need to chew on things out and not on shoes, table legs, etc.  It is also a good babysitter! When we had our dog as a puppy and at night we would want to sit down and chill out at night but she would be ready to go so we give her one of these and she would sit there for at least 2 hours chewing away.  Merrick is an excellent company with quality products that I am confident using.  I give my dog one of these every couple days, that is how long it takes her to go through one.\n",

      " I'm going to admit I'm a coffee addict but not a Starbucks fan.  Assuming you like Starbucks coffee (if you don't know...just go to a shop before you buy a package), this is a drip grind, medium strength.  It's definitely not a French/Dark roast.  It wouldn't hold cream well at all without over-powering it.<br /><br />That said, there is barely ANY vanilla taste to hit although the grounds have a strong vanilla aroma.  In general, a hazelnut coffee has about 3x the flavored taste as this does.  Yes I do realize vanilla is a much more subtle taste.<br /><br />I would recommend either adding a drop of vanilla extract, shot of vanilla syrup or vanilla cream to your already favorite cup of joe.\n",

      " Let me first say that I absolutely LOVE my coffee.<br /><br />The taste is decent, but I wouldn't call it much of a dark roast.  I was expecting a much more bold taste.  It tastes good though, and is certainly worth the money.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this coffee is that it doesn't bother my stomach.  I end up having to give away about 1/2 of my coffees because they bother my stomach so badly.<br /><br />I really can't say much more though.  All in all, this is slightly above average tasting REGULAR coffee at a great price.<br /><br />I'm going to end up giving some of these away for Christmas and drinking the rest myself.<br /><br />Would I buy again?  Probably not.  To put it simply - I prefer a bolder coffee.\n",

I've tried three cups so far. Of course it's all preference, but I think this is great. I would buy again. Strong but not too strong. Of course I do drink it slowly...this is not one to gulp down!

      " While this tea is good, its name promised more than the flavor delivered, at least the way I prepared it (steeped as a black tea). I only use a teaspoon of Splenda and no milk in my tea. If you use milk you may enjoy the tea more than I. At any rate, the tea was disappointing to me.<br /><br />Stash's chocolate hazelnut is more satisfying if it's chocolate one craves.<br /><br />While this tea was below my expectations, Talbott's Chelsea Morning Blend exceeded my hopes!\n",

      " I am an avid tea drinker who turned to the drink after realizing my body can't really tolerate coffee. I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this \"espresso\".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup.\n",

      " I'm a relatively new cat owner and admittedly have not used any other litter but this.<br />I was attracted to the fact that it's not clay, clumps and is flush-able.<br />Admittedly the odor isn't completely masked as they claim, but since we regularly scoop when home, and as long as we clean it every week and put in fresh litter, the smell is only notable if you put your face in the box.<br />Most importantly, our cat seems to like it, and in the month we've had her, she's had no adverse reactions to it (ie. no UTI problems).<br /><br />We live in a small apartment where space is limited. We bought a covered litter box, removed one of the doors from our under sink cabinet and put the box in it.<br />The fact that it's a covered box, in a cabinet, helps prevent the litter from tracking all over the place. The downside is that since our space is so small, we DO have to vacuum every time she uses the box, otherwise WE would be tracking it through the apartment!<br /><br />As far as reports of bugs, we haven't seen any evidence of a problem.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />1) It's a great alternative to clumping clay litter (which can be harmful for your cat)<br /><br />2) There is some clean up necessary after your cat uses the box. Keeping a textured floor mat at the base of your litter box helps prevent it from \"traveling\".<br /><br />3) Odor coverage is minimal, but a good diet with the least amount of filler helps waste odor.<br /><br />4) I personally have not seen evidence of bugs of any sort.<br /><br />I hope this helps other first time cat owners!\n",

      " I agree with the reviewer that stated the flavor isn't strong enough, a problem with all of the of the Artic Ice flavors, not just the pumpkin. However, I still give the product four stars because it's easy to address the problem by adding spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spices, or allspice.  I just recently purchased granulated lemon peel (it's a spice) and tried that to the chocolate flavor, it was excellent!  I'm also thinking of using the ice cream with non-fat milk and extracts, such as rum, vanilla, almond, etc. for milk shakes.  The pumpkin flavor could be used with real pumpkin, and coco powder to make a shake/smoothie that would still be low calorie.  To be honest, I wouldn't go through all of these extra steps to make the ice cream work for me if I didn't have an issue with gluten.  The low calorie count is an added bonus too.\n",

      " I tried Switch Orange Tangerine drink.  Excellent flavor and not so sweet as to make you feel you are getting a ton of sugar.  It has no added sugar and no corn sweetners, so, it is more natural than any other orange soda type drink.  More like a sparkling juice drink.  I have been a fan of orange juice and soda type drinks when as a kid I would mix OJ and Orange Soda.  Yet the natural taste of this drink is refreshing.  I tried it both with and without ice and although the iced version is more refreshing, if you get a very cold can of this drink it tasted very satisfying and did not leave you with an after taste or with the sugar blues.<br /><br />Caution, it has 34 grams of sugar, and although natural, you should check with a doc if you have sugar problems.  34 grams is equivalent to 5 or more teaspoons of sugar.  At least, if you like sparkling fruit drinks, check this one out.  I will next try it with added sparkling water to it.  Enjoy.\n",

      " I'm usually one to try new coffee flavors, though vanilla is definitely one of my favorites. So, I was more than happy to see what Starbucks meant by \"Natural Fusions\".<br /><br />As it turns out, the branding is pretty accurate.<br /><br />Rather than an overpowering candy-like vanilla that you'd get by using a flavored creamer, or most store-brand flavored coffees, Starbucks Natural Fusions tastes almost like they package a couple of vanilla beans in with plain coffee. The flavor and aroma are definitely present, but it's really much more like their House Blend with a touch of something extra.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice \"anytime\" brew that doesn't fight cream and sugar, and doesn't have the harsh aftertaste that's often present in Starbucks blends.\n",

      " The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.\n",

I have to order these on Subscribe and Save because they can't get enough of them.<br /><br />Also, the treats claim to have glucosamine and chondroitin in them, which is good for hips and back of dogs who struggle with those problem areas.

      " SO WORTH IT.  And when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is a lot of food packed into those tiny squares.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.\n",

If you are expecting the quality of a few tenths of an ounce of instant \"mix\" to be the same as a fresh pressed glass of Apple Cider, you're expectations are way too high for a product like this. This is a fancy instant drink mix in a K-Cup package.<br /><br />Just got my first package and made my first cup and it is pretty darn good. I paid $8.50 with the subscribe and save discount and for 24 K-Cups (around 35 cents each), I think it is a pretty good deal.<br /><br />You can taste the sometimes over-sweetness of the fake sugar used (heck, they only have 10 calories, there has to be a trade off!) but I regularly use Splenda in my coffee so it was not a problem.<br /><br />If you are looking for an alternative to coffee or tea in your Keurig brewer, this is a pretty good option and a pretty good price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Review-3 : \n",
      " Let me first say that I absolutely LOVE my coffee.<br /><br />The taste is decent, but I wouldn't call it much of a dark roast.  I was expecting a much more bold taste.  It tastes good though, and is certainly worth the money.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this coffee is that it doesn't bother my stomach.  I end up having to give away about 1/2 of my coffees because they bother my stomach so badly.<br /><br />I really can't say much more though.  All in all, this is slightly above average tasting REGULAR coffee at a great price.<br /><br />I'm going to end up giving some of these away for Christmas and drinking the rest myself.<br /><br />Would I buy again?  Probably not.  To put it simply - I prefer a bolder coffee.\n",

      " While this tea is good, its name promised more than the flavor delivered, at least the way I prepared it (steeped as a black tea). I only use a teaspoon of Splenda and no milk in my tea. If you use milk you may enjoy the tea more than I. At any rate, the tea was disappointing to me.<br /><br />Stash's chocolate hazelnut is more satisfying if it's chocolate one craves.<br /><br />While this tea was below my expectations, Talbott's Chelsea Morning Blend exceeded my hopes!\n",

      " I am an avid tea drinker who turned to the drink after realizing my body can't really tolerate coffee. I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this \"espresso\".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup.\n",

For help cleaning up cat puke, check my other reviews for paper towel recommendations.<br /><br />I think I'm likely to keep buying this brand.

      " The first sip of Izze's sparkling apple juice was a bit of a shock, albeit a pleasant one.  It was bright and crisp, with an unexpectedly clear bite from the carbonation.  Tart enough that it really was a bit like taking a chunk out of a fresh Granny Smith.  Granted, some of this tartness comes from the other juices used in its creation, including but not necessarily limited to lemon and white grape.  Nonetheless, the flavor profile is all apple, and what's left (to borrow Izze's own tag line) is a \"naturally delightful\" and wholly refreshing vitamin-enriched (C, B6, and Niacin) beverage, delivered in a 8.4 fluid ounce slim can.<br /><br />We were impressed enough with the apple, that we went out and picked up bottles of blueberry, clementine, and peach.  Each provided similarly terrific tastes and experiences, although we did feel that the tartness that added to the apple juice 'realism' somewhat translated to less purely-blueberry (for example) profiles for some of the other flavors.  Nonetheless, we loved them all.<br /><br />Everyone's going to have different palettes and desires, but for a household that doesn't consume soft drinks, we found these to be a tasty and welcome diversion and alternative from our normal fare.  Izze has a new group of fans, and we're looking forward to trying more flavors.  Apple, at the very least, is going to be a staple around here.\n",

      " The first sip of Izze's sparkling apple juice was a bit of a shock, albeit a pleasant one.  It was bright and crisp, with an unexpectedly clear bite from the carbonation.  Tart enough that it really was a bit like taking a chunk out of a fresh Granny Smith.  Granted, some of this tartness comes from the other juices used in its creation, including but not necessarily limited to lemon and white grape.  Nonetheless, the flavor profile is all apple, and what's left (to borrow Izze's own tag line) is a \"naturally delightful\" and wholly refreshing vitamin-enriched (C, B6, and Niacin) beverage, delivered in a 8.4 fluid ounce slim can.<br /><br />We were impressed enough with the apple, that we went out and picked up bottles of blueberry, clementine, and peach.  Each provided similarly terrific tastes and experiences, although we did feel that the tartness that added to the apple juice 'realism' somewhat translated to less purely-blueberry (for example) profiles for some of the other flavors.  Nonetheless, we loved them all.<br /><br />Everyone's going to have different palettes and desires, but for a household that doesn't consume soft drinks, we found these to be a tasty and welcome diversion and alternative from our normal fare.  Izze has a new group of fans, and we're looking forward to trying more flavors.  Apple, at the very least, is going to be a staple around here.\n",

When we had our dog as a puppy and at night we would want to sit down and chill out at night but she would be ready to go so we give her one of these and she would sit there for at least 2 hours chewing away.

For help cleaning up cat puke, check my other reviews for paper towel recommendations.<br /><br />I think I'm likely to keep buying this brand. The details on the package (what's inside, how much to use, how to transition a cat to this food, etc.) are very understandable and informative. A lower cost would be nice, but oh well.\n",
